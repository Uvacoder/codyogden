### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been crafting experiences since I was ten years old, and my passion for building great experiences and solving problems using technology continues to grow today. It all started with a JavaScript program to help me cheat on math homework--fifth grade math is tough! I have spent twenty years learning and using tech in many forms, and I'm looking for a role that allows me to connect people with technology by sharing my passion with technology and building great products.
