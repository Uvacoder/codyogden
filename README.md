# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been crafting on the web since 2001, and it all started with a JavaScript program to help me cheat on math homework--fifth grade math is tough! While Iâ€™ve spent twenty years self-learning and developing on the web, I joined a [coding bootcamp](https://primeacademy.io) primarily to network with and learn how to collaborate with a team of engineers. It was a great experience for me, and I walked away with many skills I needed to succeed in a professional engineering role.

In the middle of my software journey, I took a detour to pursue a degree in American Sign Language, a language that's fascinated me since I was a child. I lived on campus at the [Indiana School for the Deaf](https://deafhoosiers.com) to immerse myself in the Deaf World and build perspectives around disability, language, and advocacy. Iâ€™ve even been able to carry that experience into my technology career. For example, I taught technology [sign language](https://sessions.minnestar.org/sessions/660) in a talk where I introduce web accessibility.

My black goldendoodle, [Olly](https://www.instagram.com/ollyoxendoodle/), and I live together in the [Whittier neighborhood](http://www.whittieralliance.org/) in [Minneapolis, Minnesota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis). I identify as [demiguy](https://trans.wikia.org/wiki/Demiguy), and I use he/him or they/them pronouns.
